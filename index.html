        <h3>Cross Course Project (Rainydays)</h3>

        <p>This was my first major project and was based on the RainyDays brief, which involved designing and building a responsive 
          e-commerce website for a fictional jacket brand specializing in hiking and rain jackets.</p>
        <p>The goal of the project was to demonstrate my ability to create a fully functioning and responsive website using only semantic HTML and clean, well-structured CSS—without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap. 
          <br>I focused on using Flexbox and CSS Grid to create a layout that adapts smoothly across devices and screen sizes, ensuring there are no horizontal scrollbars at any width.</p>
        <p>For the visual identity, I chose a deep blue as the main color, complemented by light blue and white to give the site a clean, outdoor-inspired look. 
          <br>These choices were made to reflect the product focus—outdoor gear—and to support the brand’s logo, which featured a mountain symbol. 
          I aimed to create a site that felt natural, reliable, and user-friendly.</p>
        <p>The website structure followed the site architecture provided in the brief, including all necessary pages such as the home page, product listings, product details, checkout simulation, and contact form. 
          JavaScript functionality such as cart was added in a later course assignment.</p>
        <p>This project helped me develop strong habits in clean coding, responsive layout design, and accessibility compliance, and it laid the foundation for my future projects</p>

        <p>As part of this assignment, I was tasked with designing and developing a website for a fictional interactive science museum aimed at children aged 7–15 and families with young children. 
          <br>The goal was to demonstrate my ability to carry out independent web development using HTML and CSS, while also showcasing my accumulated design and development skills.</p>
        <p>I chose to name the museum Bjørvika Science Museum to give it a local identity. I also created the logo myself, aiming for a style that was both modern and friendly. 
          <br>The overall design of the website was meant to feel engaging and slightly mysterious, 
          to spark curiosity and encourage exploration—reflecting the spirit of science.</p>
        <p>To achieve this, I used a dark color palette with black and brown as the primary colors, giving the site a bold and immersive atmosphere while maintaining accessibility and visual clarity. 
          <br>I carefully selected fonts and layout structures to ensure content hierarchy was clear and suitable for the target audience.</p>
