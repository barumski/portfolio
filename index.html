      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Jørn-Andre Bærum, and I'm currently studying Front-end Development at Noroff. 
        <br>I enjoy both the creative and technical sides of web development — especially working with design and user experience. 
        <br>While JavaScript still feels a bit challenging, I find it exciting to learn and explore new things through code.</p>
      <p>I'm a creative problem-solver who enjoys working in a team, but I'm also comfortable working independently. 
        <br>I like building websites, taking on new challenges, and constantly improving my skills. Outside of coding, 
        <br>I'm into gaming, music, and all things tech.</p>
